# EFWeather

This is a school project done with WinForms,,, 
the languagae in the app is partially in swedish
practicing to get data from a CSV-file, store the data in a SQL-DB and manipulating data (NOT changing the data).


To be mentioned!!!
there are few error-exception that I didn't put there.
for exemple if you choose to go to the "statistik" without having any data stored in the DB.
